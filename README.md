# Virtual World Simulator

This project is the implementation of a Virtual World Simulator project in C++ for the OOP course. The simulator creates a two-dimensional grid of a customizable size that represents the virtual world. The world is populated with different forms of life, each with unique behaviors and characteristics.

The simulator visualizes the world in the console using ASCII symbols to represent different organisms. Pressing a key advances the simulation to the next turn, clears the console, and displays the updated state of the game. A dedicated line in the console is used to report events such as feeding or combat results.
